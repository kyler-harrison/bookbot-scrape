- 2000 titles split into 10 per batch takes ~4.45 hours
- 1000 titles split into 10 per batch batch takes ~90 minutes
- after first 3219 scrape (~21 hrs, 33 min), ~1.7e6 unique words, ~50 titles per word on average, search is no big deal after loaded, 371 mb json
- merger of 100 titles master word json with 2000 titles master word json complete in ~39 seconds
  ^ if plugged in it goes quicker
- json to json array of 2100 titles master word data takes ~13 seconds
- merger of 2000 titles master word json with 2000 titles master word json complete in ~23 seconds (plugged into power)
- json to json array of 4100 titles master word data takes ~23 seconds
- 0 to 2100 took ~4.5 hours
- 2100 to 4100 took ~4.5 hours
- 4100 to 6100 took ~7.4 hours (I'm guessing these were more popular titles - more words)
- ~44 seconds to merge 0-4100 master word json and 4100-6100 master word json
- ~140 ms to insert 2000 new titles to title metadata collection
- attempted to update existing 2000 titles master word mongo collection with 2000 titles master word json, got a memory allocation error after
  20 minutes of running. I have no idea how long it would have take to complete the entire update, and I don't know why I ran out of memory,
	perhaps I need to read the file as a stream? but still wouldn't it have crashed earlier if the file was too much for RAM? read that node js
	by default gets 512 mb of memory and you can set more. but considering the server I'm going to set up will only have 1 gb of RAM, that doesn't 
	seem like the answer. perhaps just merge jsons on the server if scp'ing the big json takes too long, and then importing straight into mongo. 
	json merges are quick and so is a mongo import, most time will be spent on sending the file(s) over. I guess to update once running, I can just
	send over the new json (2000 titles max or whatever doesn't take an unreasonable amount of time to send over) and merge and import again since the
	updates seem to be slow
